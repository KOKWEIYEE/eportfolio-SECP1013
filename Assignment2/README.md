## Reflection
During the visit, we explored various area such as Open Office, Digital Care and TM Room. The facility that is available there far exceed my 
expectation. We were briefed on the daily responsibilities of the staff at UTMDigital, who ensure the smooth functioning of the digital systems 
at UTM. What impressed me the most was our visit to the UTM Data Center, typically inaccessible to the public. It was my initial exposure to an 
extensive and intricate infrastructure that handle massive data. This experience has motivated me to exert more effort in my software engineering 
studies, aspiring to make remarkable contributions to society.

The industrial visit provides us with a chance to witness firsthand how the theoretical knowledge we have learned in class is used in real world
situations. By interacting with employees and touring various locations, we get exposed to a company's operation and learn about technical tools
and skills required to maintain a complex digital sysytem through collaboration accross multiple departments. As result, our learning process goes 
beyond just the slides and notes, and we gain extra knowledge through the visit to UTMDigtal.
