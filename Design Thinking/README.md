# Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype)
Hello! For design thinking project, we are required to write a report, produce a video and prototype then do a presentation. Design thinking is a process of critical thinking used to develop solutions to problems throuhj collaboration, innovation and design.

## Time to Link
This is our design thinking project name. We found that disconnection between students often happens due to a lack of availability for student networking. Such instances could range from minor information to a
piece of information with great significance. Hence this will create a gap of information and a possible misread or misleading exchange of knowledge.Our goal is to create an application that allows students from different years to connect and share information to help each other. The
information would be centralized and categorized in this app.

### Reflection
My aspiration in pursuing this course is to gain understanding about trend technologies. By using professional knowledge and skill set, I can craft innovative solutions for real-world problems and contribute to the technological landscape in
Malaysia. Besides, it could enhance my job opportunities by distinguishing myself from others. I hope that I am able to develop software applications that not only showcase technical proficiency but also have a meaningful impact on peopleâ€™s life. 

</p>This design thinking project has taught me the importance of user-centric mindset. I have learned to empathize with their needs and preferences, leading to solutions that are more intuitive. Moreover, I understand effective communication
and collaboration in a group are the foundation for success. Combining unique strengths and different perspectives from each group member contribute to a well-rounded approach to problem-solving.

</a></p>As the technology industry is getting more competitive nowadays, it is crucial for us to stay ahead by seeking opportunities and paying attention to the
industry trends. I need to enroll myself in professional development programs to expand my social networking and get information. I should prepare myself earlier
by training hard skills and soft skills to excel in my future career.
