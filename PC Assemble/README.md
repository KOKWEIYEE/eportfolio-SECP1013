# PC Assemble
Hello! On November 1, 2023, we have invloved in PC maintanance class to learn how to assemble and disassemble a PC with a techinician step by step.

## Reflection
The laboratory session has truly ignited my interest in hardware, especially considering it's my very first attempt at assemble a computer. Initially, I anticipated the process to be challenging, given my lack of experience in assembling PCs. However, the technician who guided us did an outstanding job, patiently elucidating every crucial component.

Participating in the assembly allowed me to not only see but also touch various computer hardware components. The process proved to be intricate, particularly due to the chaotic circuit is so delicate that a single misstep could result in complete devastation. Additionally, the technician emphasized the importance of handling the RAM with care to avoid potential damage, a detail I hadn't considered before. Personally, the most challenging part of the assembly was to remember every components of the PC.

However, through the collaboration among our team members, we successfully emerged as the fastest group to complete the assembly. This experience made me realize the importance of teamwork. Despite the thought-provoking nature of this lab session, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The hands-on experience provided invaluable benefits, offering insightful glimpses into the hardware industry.
