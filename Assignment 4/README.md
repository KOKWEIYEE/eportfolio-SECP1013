# Industrial Talk 3: Tech-Driven Innovation
Hello! For assignment 4, we are required to produce a newsletter on an industrial talk given by Dr. Seah Choon Sen about how I-Farm plans for urban farming.

## Reflection
First of all, I would like to thank Dr. Seah for his insightful sharing of knowledge and expertise about the usage of technology that he had implemented in the I-farm. It was an enlightening experience to learn about the implementation of Vertical Farming technology with Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and IoT system. 

The integration of an Internet of Things (IoT) system into the agriculture field helps to improve the efficiency of I-farm. Users can monitor the growth of the crops and choose to harvest the amount they need. Besides that, I-farm also eases the work of users so they do not have to go to grocery stores to purchase fresh groceries. 
 
From this talk, I have learned that it is crucial to do market segmentation so that we can identify the right group of targeted customers. I have also learned how important it is to make a competitor analysis. As system developers, we can identify our system's strengths and weaknesses compared to potential competitors that are available in the market. It helps us to improve what we are weak at in order to make sure we can stand out among our competitors and make sure the targeted group of customers will choose us over our competitors.
 
I am amazed by the potential of technology, and I look forward to applying it in my future career to be like Dr. Seah and build a system that brings plenty of benefits to people and the environment. We can apply technology in many fields, such as automation, hospitality, and agriculture. I will always remember what I have learned from Dr. Seah and contribute to the country and its people to make their lives easier and healthier.
